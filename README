Query the Public Suffix List from PostgreSQL.


Installation:

  make install

  Then, in psql: CREATE EXTENSION pglibpsl;


Dependencies:

  libpsl
  postgresql


Usage:

  SELECT psl_regdomain('a.b.c.example.co.uk');
   psl_regdomain 
  ---------------
   example.co.uk
  (1 row)


Why not pgpsl?

  The pgpsl extension uses an unmaintained in-tree copy of the apparently
  unmaintained regdom-libs, which doesn't seem to be widely used.

  pglibpsl instead uses the local system's libpsl, which is both maintained and
  battle tested (packaged in most distributions, and depended on by wget and
  curl).
